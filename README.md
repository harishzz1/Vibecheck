```
❌ "Invalid API key"
✅ Check .env.local file has correct GEMINI_API_KEY
```

```
❌ Chat not responding
✅ Ensure Next.js dev server is running on port 3000/3001
```

### **Scan Issues**
```
❌ "No vulnerabilities found" in obviously vulnerable code
✅ Check Python scanner service is running on port 5000
```

```
❌ "Failed to scan directory"
✅ Ensure Semgrep is installed: pip install semgrep
```

## 💬 **Example Conversations**

### **General Security Question**
```
User: "What are the most common web application vulnerabilities?"

AI: "The most common web application vulnerabilities include:

1. **SQL Injection (CWE-89)** - Attackers manipulate database queries
2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79)** - Malicious scripts executed in browsers
3. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** - Unauthorized actions on behalf of users
4. **Insecure Authentication** - Weak login/session management
5. **Security Misconfigurations** - Default passwords, open ports, etc.

Would you like me to explain any of these in detail or show you how to prevent them in your specific codebase?"
```

### **Specific Vulnerability Question**
```
User: [Clicks on SQL Injection vulnerability in file.php:42]

AI: "I see you have a SQL injection vulnerability in file.php at line 42. This appears to be caused by directly concatenating user input into a SQL query.

**The Issue:**
```php
$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " . $_GET['id'];
```

**Why it's dangerous:**
An attacker could input `1 OR 1=1--` to bypass authentication or `1; DROP TABLE users;--` to delete data.

**The Fix:**
Use prepared statements:
```php
$stmt = $pdo->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?");
$stmt->execute([$_GET['id']]);
```

Would you like me to explain how prepared statements work or help you fix other similar issues in your codebase?"
```
