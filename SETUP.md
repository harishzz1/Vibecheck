## üåê API Endpoints

### Frontend (Next.js)
- `GET /` - Main application interface
- `POST /api/chat` - AI chatbot conversation endpoint
- `POST /api/autofix` - AI-powered code fixing

### Backend (Flask)
- `GET /health` - Service health check
- `POST /scan` - Vulnerability scanning for uploaded files
- `POST /scan-directory` - Vulnerability scanning for local directories

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini 2.0 Pro via REST API
- **Backend**: Flask with Semgrep for vulnerability scanning
- **File Handling**: File System Access API for secure browser-based file access
- **Security**: Environment-based configuration, input validation, path sanitization

## üö® Important Security Notes

1. **Never commit API keys** - Always use environment variables
2. **Production deployment** - Ensure FLASK_DEBUG=False in production
3. **API key security** - Restrict API key usage and monitor quotas
4. **File permissions** - The app only reads files, never modifies without explicit user action

## üîß Troubleshooting

### API Key Issues
- Ensure your Gemini API key is valid and has appropriate quotas
- Check the API key is properly set in `.env.local`
- Verify the key has access to the Gemini 2.0 Pro model

### Scanning Issues
- Make sure Python dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Verify Semgrep is accessible in your PATH
- Check that the scanner service is running on port 5000

### Browser Compatibility
- File System Access API requires Chrome 86+, Edge 86+, or Opera 72+
- For other browsers, consider using the upload functionality
